## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Data Cleaning & Preparation
The EDA focused on understanding the structure, completeness, and key distributions within the dataset. The steps included:
* **Data Structure Audit:** The presence of 1,465 rows and 16 columns covering product names, categories, prices, discounts, ratings, and review information was verified.
* **Missing Values:** Removed blank and irrelevant entries e.g., NULL, missing prices and invalid data entry under rating.
* **Duplicates:** Removed duplicate product_ids
* **Data Type Conversion:** Converted pricing and rating fields from general to currency and numerical formats for accurate calculation.
* **Category Cleaning:** Extracted top-level/main product categories from multi-tiered category strings to allow consistent grouping.
* **Product Cleaning:** Shortened product name.

### Derived Fields: Created several new columns including:
* Potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count)
* Number of Review by splitting comma-separated Review IDs using excel function
  `=COUNTA(TEXTSPLIT(R2,,","))` where R is Review_ID.
* Price Range Bucket to categorize products into < ₹200, ₹200–₹500, and > ₹500 using excel function
  `=IF(F2<200," <₹200",IF(F2<=500,"₹200–₹500",">₹500"))` where F is Discounted_price.
* 50% Discount marker for products with ≥50% discount using excel function
  `=IF(J2>=50%,"50% or more","<50%")` where J is Discount_percentage.
* Discount bucket to categorize products into 0-25%, 26-50%, 51-75%, 76-100% using excel function
  `=IF(J2<=25%,"0-25%",IF(J2<=50%,"26-50%",IF(J2<=75%,"51-75%","76-100%")))` where J is Discount_percentage.

The cleaned and enhanced dataset had a total 1348 rows and 23 columns which enabled deeper statistical and business analysis, as well as visual storytelling through PivotTables and charts.

## Recommendations for Product Improvement, Marketing, and Customer Engagement

1. **Focus on High-Performing Categories**  
   Electronics, Home & Kitchen, and Computers & Accessories consistently top product count, reviews, and revenue potential. Prioritize these categories for new product launches, detailed competitive analysis, and optimized advertising.

2. **Refine Discount Strategies for Maximum Impact**  
   While Electronics sees significant price reductions, data shows **no strong correlation between higher discounts and better ratings**. Avoid deep discounts unless they’re part of broader campaigns; instead, emphasize product quality and reviews to drive conversion.

3. **Leverage Top Brands and Products**  
   Highlight and promote best-rated and most-reviewed brands like **boAT, Samsung, Zebronics, AmazonBasics, and Bajaj**. These drive trust and engagement—ideal for bundling, cross-selling, and sponsored placements.

4. **Optimize for Review Generation**  
   A substantial number of products (307) have fewer than 1,000 reviews. Invest in post-purchase review campaigns, follow-ups, and review incentives to boost social proof, especially for newer or underperforming SKUs.

5. **Target Premium Segments Thoughtfully**  
   With most products priced above ₹500, tailor your marketing and messaging toward premium customers. Ensure value propositions (durability, features, brand trust) are clearly communicated in listings and ads.

6. **Promote Products from Well-Rated Subcategories**  
   Products in categories like **Computer Accessories** and **Home & Kitchen Appliances** have some of the highest customer ratings. Focus on promoting these products more, and consider adding similar items to your catalog that match their quality and customer appeal.

7. **Stand Out in Crowded Categories**  
   Categories like **Electronics** are very competitive but also receive the most customer attention. To succeed here, highlight what makes your product different—such as unique features, better quality, or additional services like free installation or extended warranties.

8. **Be Cautious with Heavy Discounts**  
   Over 660 products have discounts over 50%, but many of these may not be profitable or performing well. Instead of always using large discounts, try limited-time deals, bundle offers, or loyalty programs to attract buyers while protecting profit margins.

9. **Monitor and Adjust Rating Trends**  
   With most products rated between 4.0–4.3, maintain a strong focus on customer service, shipping experience, and accurate product descriptions to prevent dips below this favorable range.

10. **Boost Discovery of High Potential Products**  
    Use the **Rating × Review count metric** to continuously identify rising stars. Prioritize these in email campaigns, homepage spots, and seasonal promotions.

## Limitations & Assumptions

- **Assumed Revenue Calculation:**  
  Potential revenue was estimated using `Actual Price × Rating_Count`. This does not account for product returns, abandoned carts, or discounts actually applied at checkout.

- **Discount Interpretation:**  
  Discount percentages were taken at face value without validating real-time market price changes or time-limited promo codes.

- **Static Snapshot:**  
  Data reflects a specific point in time. Seasonal trends, flash sales, and new product launches may impact future performance and should be monitored continuously.

##  Conclusion

The Amazon Product Review Analysis has uncovered strategic insights into product performance, customer engagement, and discount effectiveness within a highly competitive e-commerce environment.

Key takeaways emphasize that categories like **Electronics, Home & Kitchen, and Computers & Accessories** dominate in volume, reviews, and potential revenue, making them critical focus areas for future growth. Interestingly, while heavy discounting is widespread, it does not directly correlate with higher customer satisfaction—underscoring the importance of balancing price strategy with perceived value.

Top-performing brands such as **boAT, Samsung, Zebronics, AmazonBasics, and Bajaj** emerged as key drivers of trust and engagement. These should be leveraged for promotions, bundling, and visibility campaigns. Furthermore, the data highlights the need to invest in **review generation tactics**, especially for the 307 products with fewer than 1,000 reviews.

Most products fall into premium pricing (>₹500), indicating the importance of tailored messaging to quality-conscious consumers. Moreover, the weak link between high discounts and ratings suggests that **brand trust, review count, and product quality** remain stronger levers for conversion than price cuts alone.

Overall, this analysis provides a roadmap for **data-driven decision-making**—from optimizing listings and pricing to enhancing marketing and customer engagement strategies. The findings should guide e-commerce teams to focus on long-term value creation rather than short-term promotional tactics.
